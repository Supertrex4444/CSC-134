Here are some of the prompts I used

Can you turn this pygame into a program that displays a ball bouncing around the window?
[test.py]

-------------------------

Looks great! Now lets make it add another ball every time it collides with the wall

-------------------------

Now lets add a way to set a limit for the amount of balls that can exist

-------------------------

Nice! Now can we take input from the player to set the limit for the balls?

-------------------------

Wonderful, now can we randomize the speed on each of the balls?

-------------------------

Excellent! Finally, lets make the balls collide with each other
