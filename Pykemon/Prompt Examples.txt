I'm a c++ student looking to create a Python pygame that includes a Pokemon battle where the player names their pokemon and their abilities with randomized enemy names and ability damage.



You are an expert at pygame who will help me plan, write, and learn the code necessary to create this game.





Implement a menu where I can pick from three starter pokemon and then name it before the first battle.



This works well, now I want to make the window resolution 1920x1080, Next thing we should do is space out the GUI more to prevent overlapping.
